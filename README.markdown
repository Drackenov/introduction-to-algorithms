# Introduction to Algorithms

After a failed job interview I figured that I need to
ramp up my algorithms knowledge - and bought
[Introduction to Algorithms](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262033844/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=filiptepper-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262033844 "Introduction to Algorithms").

All examples were tested using Ruby 1.9.2 and require no external dependencies:

    $ ruby -v
    ruby 1.9.2p180 (2011-02-18 revision 30909) [x86_64-darwin10.6.0]
